IRIS - Inflation Resisting Intervension System
These days, the cost of goods is rising daily. However, "the farmer," who is entitled to
profit, frequently experiences a loss. Hence, to address this issue introducing the project
"IRIS".
IRIRS is an Android application made using Android studio Java language.
The idea of balancing is introduced on this platform. Balancing refers to containing
the powerful forces of demand and supply. This project will benefit everyone involved in the
entire farming cycle, not just farmers. The project will also be responsible for lowering the
cost of goods by removing the inessential entities between the supply chain.
The idea behind the project's name is that the system will resist inflation by disrupting
and neutralising the factors that are causing inflation. The application is created primarily to
benefit farmers. One of the few industries that has not seen technological advancement is
agriculture and farming.
The project will not only benefit farmers but also the final customers. Consumers will
acquire goods at minimal cost, and those goods will be more nutrient-rich with the least
amount of chemical use possible. To minimise effort, each crop cycle will be carefully
planned and tracked, and data will be gathered in a database.
